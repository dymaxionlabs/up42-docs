## What is an UP42 credit?
An UP42 credit is a token of value that hides from the developer thepricing complexity across all data and processing blocks.

 
Credits come in prepaid bundles. Just go to[settings/credits/purchase](https://up42.com/settings/credit/purchase),select the plan with the number of credits you want and enter yourcredit card information. If you want to buy credits in larger bundles,please contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@up42.com)

## How are credits used on UP42?

Every time you run a job for a workflow credits are consumed in:

 1. **Data** acquisition through the use of data blocks.
 2. **Processing** blocks that process the acquired data and return an output.
 4. **Infrastructure** costs: CPU and storage usage.

## Why are there different prices/credit values for blocks?

It depends on the particular block, be it data or processing. Thepricing is dictated by our data provider and processing partners.

 1. Free data, e.g., freely made available on the Internet you only pay the data transfer and the infrastructure usage required to acquire the data for that particular data block.
 2. Commercial data is priced by our data provider partners: we reflect their cost and add our data transfer and infrastructure costs.
 3. Processing blocks are priced according to the type of algorithm they provide. The pricing unit can be storage units, like MB, area units, like square km, optical resolution units, like MP, etc. The unit used depends on the particular block being used.

## Where can I find information on individual block pricing and usage restrictions?

In each block details page you will find details on the exact definition of the pricing unit for that block and the number of credits per unit, as well as a link to any specific terms and conditions you need to agree to in order to use the data block.

## Can I estimate upfront how many credits my job will consume?

You can get an idea of the overall credit usage for a particular job
by:

 1. Looking at the details of each block in your workflow
 2. Run test jobs with small **A**reas **O**f **I**nterest (AOIs) to get an idea on credit usage before running a job with a larger AOI.

## Is the data sources I can access dependent on the credit package I acquire?

No. The different packages are purely driven by volume of credits. Note that certain data blocks, due to the sensitivity of the provided data, require you to go through a compliance check before you are allowed to use them. This is independent of the credit package you acquire.


## Can I get a refund for credits I no longer need?

No, credits are not refundable. If you don't know how many you need, it's better to start with smaller packs of credits and only upgrade to larger credit packs once you have an idea of how many credits the use case you have in mind will consume.


## How can I avoid recurring charges for auto-renewal of the credit packs I have acquired?

You can stop auto-renewal of your chosen credit pack at any time via your account page. Please note that if you do this there is a risk of running out of credits before a job completes, as we cannot always tell upfront exactly how many credits a job will consume. Credits used for an interrupted job are non-refundable. If you cancel auto-renewal and still intend to run jobs, it is up to you to ensure that you have enough credits for a given job to complete successfully.

OR:

Once you have stopped auto-renewal, we will continue to allow you to run jobs with your remaining credits. If a job uses more credits than you have, we will automatically charge your card for the **smallest** available credit pack to cover those credits. After this, no more jobs can be started.

## My job stopped in the middle of the process. Will I still get charged?

If you are in debug / test mode, then you will not be charged for executing jobs.

You will be charged for any data you have extracted from our data providers (do we want to specify conditions for charging or not charging based on whose fault it is, i.e. if a block failed from provider or there was a platform failure versus custom block code error or configuration mistake?)

## How do I choose the right package?

We generally recommend starting with a package that will last you approximately 1 month. Start with smaller credit packs and upgradeonce you get more insights into how many credits your processesconsume on UP42. To get a feeling for what has been done with different credit packs, please see <link to package examples>

## What happens if I run out of credits?

By default, we will automatically bill your credit card for a newbatch of credits if you run out. This ensures that your processes continue to run smoothly.
