# API FAQ

## Does UP42 have an API?
 
Yes. We are a developer focused company, so you can think of the API
as our **main** product.
 
## What can be done through the API?
 
Using the project key available at 
`https://up42.com/console/projects/<project_id>/settings`, where
`<project_id>` is your project assigned
[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier),
you can do everything within the project:

 1. Add/remove blocks, thus modifying the workflow.
 2. Create, run, cancel jobs.
 3. And much, much more: see [API documentation](https://docs.up42.com/api/index.html).
 
## Where can I learn more about the UP42 API?
 
To learn more about our API and the concepts underlying it go to our
[documentation](https://docs.up42.com) site.
