   AOI
      **A**\ rea **O**\ f **I**\ nterest is a
      polygonal region on a map defining the area where a given action
      is to be performed: data acquisition, data processing, etc.

   AOI clipped
      Data block output that includes only the items that either:
      intersect the AOI or fully contain that AOI depending on the
      chosen :ref:`filter <filters>`.

   block
      Unit corresponding to either a data acquisition or a
      processing stage in a :term:`workflow`.

   bounding box
      GeoJSON geometry represented by a rectangle
      containing the coordinates of the southwesterly most extent --
      bottom left corner of the box -- followed by the coordinates of
      the northeasterly most extent -- top right corner of the box --
      specified in Longitude/Latitude based on `WGS 84
      <http://www.opengis net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CR 84>`__.

   console
      The **U**\ ser **I**\ nterface of the UP42 platform. It allows
      you to do all actions related with :term:`project`,
      :term:`workflow`, :term:`job` as well as manage your account and
      credit settings.

   custom block
      A :term:`block` that is pushed by a costumer to the UP42 docker
      registry and is therefore private, i.e., it can only used by
      that customer.

   data block
      A :term:`block` that provides satellite image data or other geospatial data.    
      
   demo project
      Project that is created when a customer confirms the
      email address associated with his/her account. This project
      comes with consists of a simple :term:`workflow` of a data and
      processing :term:`block`. The workflow is also automatically
      instantiated (run) to provide a first :term:`job` output.

   download block
      A term:`data block` that allows for downloading an image
      granting indefinite rights to its usage. 
      
   EVI
      **E**\ nhanced **V**\ egetation **I**\ ndex complements
      :term:`NDVI` in the sense that it looks for indicators of
      vegetation health to which NVDI is less sentitive to.
      Read `here
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_vegetation_index>`_ more
      about it.

   full scene
      Data block output that includes the complete area covered by
      the satellite instrument when it it was over that area. In this
      case the selected AOI is used to search for the scene(s) that
      include(s) the specified AOI.

   job
      An instance of a :term:`workflow`.

   job inputs
      See :term:`job parameters`.

   job parameters
      The JSON that includes the configuration for each :term:`block`
      in a given :term:`workflow`.

   NDVI
      **N**\ ormalized **D**\ ifference **V**\ egetation **I**\
      ndex. One of the most widespread vegetation indexes used to
      infer vegetation health and vitality. See the Wikipedia `entry
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index>`_
      about it.
      
   processing block
      A :term:`block` that takes input from a :term:`data block` and applies a processing operation to the data.

   project
      A named single collection of workflows and their corresponding
      jobs.

   quicklooks
      A low resolution RGB bitmap image for previewing a given output.

   scene
      A scene is an image captured by an earth observation
      satellite over a specific area and recorded by a particular
      instrument onboard that satellite. The instrument can be
      optical, in which case the output is a digital image in a given
      light band, e.g., RGB, panchromatic, Short Wave Infrared, Near
      Infrared, etc. It can also be a radiometric instrument, i.e.,
      Synthetic Aperture Radar, microwave radiometer, spectrometer,
      etc. Depending on the type of instrument the output product
      might be or not a digital image.
      
   task
      A block in the context of a job, e.g., the :ref:`Pleiades data
      block <pleiades-aoiclipped-block>` is a task in a :term:`job`
      for a :term:`workflow` that uses this data block.

   testquery
      A job that consisting only in querying for data given a set of
      :ref:`filters <filters>` from an upstream data provider. Not all
      data providers might implement this functionality. The output
      is a GeoJSON enumerating the available data items. If no data
      exists for a particular query an empty GeoJSON is returned.

   workflow
      A directed acyclic graph of blocks [#]_. See :ref:`definition <workflows-definition>`.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Currently the workflow is a `linked list
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list>`__
       of blocks. With a data
       block always at the root. Full DAG based workflows will be
       implemented in the future.
