.. _support-request:

How can I get support from UP42 for my projects?
------------------------------------------------

Mail to `support@up42.com <mailto:support%20@up42.com>`__.

How do I signup for an account?
-------------------------------

1. Go to our `homepage <https://up42.com>`__.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
3. Fill in the field with your email address.
4. Click on the **Register for Beta**.
5. Done.

My job gives strange results or it keeps failing. Can you help me debug it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We might. No guarantees. Create a :ref:`support request <support-request>` and please provide the job **parameters**, available on the UI on the parameters tab in the job page.

Where can I learn more about Docker?
------------------------------------

`Docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com>`__ is a good place to
start.

Does UP42 provides public images in its docker registry?
--------------------------------------------------------

No **all** images in our Docker registry are **private**.

Can I write my custom block in programming language X?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Containers are programming language agnostic. You can write in
whatever programming language suits your needs and preferences.

Two blocks (e.g.Â Landsat 8 and Airbus ship detection) can be run together as their capabilities match, but the ship detection then fails. Why is that so?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matching capabilities in a workflow is a necessary requirement to run it
and automatically checked by the workflow editor. This avoids mismatches
such as an algorithm expecting a Sentinel-1 GRD image file is started
with a RGB image from a multispectral sensor. Currently the capabilities
matching process though is not able to identify all mismatches between
blocks. Please read the `block
description <https://docs.up42.com/specifications/capabilities.html#block-capabilities>`__
carefully to understand if the input requirements are met before trying
to use a block in your workflow.
  
My block needs auxiliary files. Where should I store them and how should I fetch them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far we don't have a defined mechanism for storing and accessing auxiliary files which are e.g. needed for
calibration of an algorithm. As the processing cluster is not firewalled off so far it is possible to store such files
on a storage space in the internet e.g. by using AWS, Google Cloud or Azure. In the future we might need to implement
tighter security measures, so please inform us if your block uses such a mechanism.

I tried to obtain some imagery for Pleaides and/or SPOT and when using the Airbus GeoStore I get more images. Why is that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The imagery we have on our platform for Pleiades and/or SPOT are
provided to us via the **OneAtlas Living Library API**.  The images
available are filtered for cloud cover and incidence angle. Therefore
you might obtain an image in the Airbus GeoStore that has too many
clouds and/or the incidence angle is not optimal. Those images will be
discarded by the OneAtlas Living Library. One Atlas imposes image
quality thresholds that are not imposed by the Airbus GeoStore.
