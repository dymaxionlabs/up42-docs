Marketplace FAQ
===============

Why should I become a UP42 partner --- joining the marketplace?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There many reasons for that. A few of them are listed
`here <https://up42.com/data-and-processing>`__.

How can I get my block on the UP42 marketplace?
-----------------------------------------------

1. `Sign up <https://up42.com>`__ for an account.
2. Try out your **private** block.
3. `Reach out <mailto:support@up42.com>`__ to us to know how to proceed
   from there.

What options are there to monetize my block?
--------------------------------------------

There are many possibilities for that. `Get in
touch <mailto:support@up42.com>`__ with us to know more.

Is the **I**\ ntellectual **P**\ roperty (IP) embedded in my marketplace blocks safe?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The long and short answer is **yes** it is. Why? Because:

1. Users cannot download your block or get access to any of the
   internals. Once your block is published in our **private** Docker
   registry **you and only you** have access to it.

2. We treat your block as a **black box** it gets inputs and sets
   outputs. That’s all.

3. Users can only add/remove your block to/from their workflow. They
   cannot do anything else with it.

4. Please note that it is up to you to define the logging in your block
   in a way that doesn’t reveal any inside details about it. If you are
   curious about how a block might look like check our `land cover demo
   block <https://github.com/up42/land-cover-classification-demo>`__ to
   have an idea on how to build your own block.

How and when does UP42 pay me?
