# Marketplace FAQ

## How can I get my block on the UP42 marketplace?
 
  1. [Sign up](https://up42.com) for an account.
  2. Try out your **private** block.
  3. [Reach out](mailto:support@up42.com) to us to know how to proceed from there. 
 
## What options are there to monetize my block?
 
 There are many possibilities for that. [Get in touch](mailto:support@up42.com) with us to know more.
 
## Is the **I**ntellectual **P**roperty (IP) embedded in my marketplace blocks safe?
 
 The long and short answer is **yes** it is. Why? Because:
 
 1. Users cannot download your block or get access to any of the internals. Once your block is published in our **private** Docker registry **you and only you** have access to it. 
    
 2. We treat your block as a **black box** it gets inputs and sets outputs. That's all.
 
 3. Users can only add/remove your block to/from their workflow. They cannot do anything else with it.
 
 4. Please note that it is up to you to define the logging in your block in a way that doesn't reveal any inside details about it. If you are curious about how a block might look like check our [land cover demo block](https://github.com/up42/land-cover-classification-demo) to have an idea on how to build your own block.
