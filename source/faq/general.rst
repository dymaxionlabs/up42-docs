Can I write my custom block in programming language X?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Containers are programming language agnostic. You can write in
whatever programming language suits your needs and preferences.

Two blocks (e.g.Â Landsat 8 and Airbus ship detection) can be run together as their capabilities match, but the ship detection then fails. Why is that so?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matching capabilities in a workflow is a necessary requirement to runit
and automatically checked by the workflow editor. This avoids mismatches
such as an algorithm expecting a Sentinel-1 GRD image file is started
with a RGB image from a multispectral sensor. Currently the capabilities
matching process though is not able to identify all mismatches between
blocks. Please read the `block
description <https://docs.up42.com/specifications/capabilities.html#block-capabilities>`__
carefully to understand if the input requirements are met before trying
to use a block in your workflow.
