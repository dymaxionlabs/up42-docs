Welcome to the UP42 documentation
=================================

Here you can find comprehensive information on how to use UP42 in all
its aspects. Below we provide you quick & easy entry points into our
documentation.

First steps
-----------

Relying on the :term:`console` go from running and looking at the
job results for the demo project to running a job using the API, passing
by creating a workflow.

+ :ref:`Run your first UP42 job <first-job-run>`
+ :ref:`Your first workflow <build-first-workflow>`
+ :ref:`Your first API request <first-api-request>`

Going further
-------------

Get to understand the concepts underliyng UP42. What type of data
filters are available and how they work. Walkthrough the API: what endpoints
are available and how to request them.

+ :ref:`Core concepts <core-concepts>`
+ :ref:`Data filters <filters>`
+ :ref:`API tutorial <api-walkthrough>`

Introduction to running your own code
-------------------------------------

Use our demo processing block offered as free software on
`Github <https://github.com/up42/land-cover-classification-demo>`_ to
create your first custom block. Then learn how to develop **your own**
processing block and, if need be, make use of GPUs to speed it up.

+ :ref:`Push your first block <first-custom-block>`
+ :ref:`Develop your block <custom-processing-block-dev>`
+ :ref:`Use GPUs in your block <adding-gpu-support-block>`
